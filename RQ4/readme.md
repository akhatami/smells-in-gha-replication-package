# RQ 4

## Contributions
To find the projects we want to contribute to we used the [contribution_repo.py](./scripts/conribution_repo.py) to find repositories that match our criteria. 
A list with all the PRs we have opened during the contribution study can be found in [Contribution study.xlsx](./Contribution%20study.xlsx). 
**Following any of the links in this file to the contributions or comments violate the double blindedness of the review.** 

## Extracting comments
The script we used to extract the comments can be found in [comment-extraction.py](./scripts/comment-extraction.py).
In order to use the script, firstly install the required dependencies and add a GitHub API token on line 32. 
We originally filtered out our comments, this condition has been updated to ensure the double blind.
